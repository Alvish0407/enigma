The Enigma machine is a **cipher** **device** developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication. It was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II, in all branches of the German military. The Enigma machine was considered so secure that it was used to encipher the most top-secret messages. 

The Enigma has an electromechanical **rotor mechanism** that scrambles the 26 letters of the alphabet. In typical use, one person enters text on the Enigma's keyboard and another person writes down which of the 26 lights above the keyboard illuminated at each key press. If **plain text** is entered, the illuminated letters are the encoded **ciphertext**. Entering ciphertext transforms it back into readable plaintext. The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress.

I have created the same but very small portion of that machine to show how it works actually. It's very minimal encryption algorithm.
